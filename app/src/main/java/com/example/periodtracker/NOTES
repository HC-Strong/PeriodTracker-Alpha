These are just my notes on development. Probably somewhere better to put them, but oh well

record classes
Gonna need:

Cycle: which stores start and end dates and an array of the dates in that range stored as:
DailyInfo: items for array containing all info for each date. nullable in case user submits not date
            val LocalDate, vars for period info, symptom info
PeriodInfo and SymptomInfo should inherit from something probably. call it Info

Also cycle needs methods for CalcEstPeriodStart and CalcEstFertility or something

And I'll need a variable to store the current cycle object



THINGS TO FIX LATER

**** I was gonna add a class for PeriodInfo and SymptomInfo to inherit from and probably should
But the name I was gonna use (Info) implies it's a parent to DailyInfo as well as period and symptom info.
Which it wouldn't be. Also not totally sure how to make that work and I'm not using symptoms yet
Later



****I'm going to start with making start and end dates of a cycle immutable so I can use LocalDate
But that's not a good idea in the long run. I'll fix it later
